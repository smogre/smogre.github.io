A variety of cellular components are transported via hitchhiking by attaching to other motile organelles. Defects in the molecular machinery responsible for organelle hitchhiking may be linked with neurodegenerative disorders. To date, no comprehensive physical models of this non-canonical mode of transport have been developed. In particular, the connection between molecular- and organelle-scale properties of hitchhiking components and their effect on cellular-scale transport has remained unclear. Here, we investigate the mechanics of hitchhiking initiation and explore organelle interactions that can modulate the efficiency of this process.
