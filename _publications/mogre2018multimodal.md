excerpt: 'Intracellular components explore the cytoplasm via active motor-driven transport in conjunction with passive diffusion. We model the motion of organelles in narrow tubular cells using analytical techniques and numerical simulations to study the efficiency of different transport modes in achieving various cellular objectives. Our model describes length and time scales over which each transport mode dominates organelle motion, along with various metrics to quantify exploration of intracellular space. For organelles that search for a specific target, we obtain the average capture time for given transport parameters and show that diffusion and active motion contribute to target capture in the biologically relevant regime. Because many organelles have been found to tether to microtubules when not engaged in active motion, we study the interplay between immobilization due to tethering and increased probability of active transport. We derive parameter-dependent conditions under which tethering enhances long-range transport and improves the target capture time. These results shed light on the optimization of intracellular transport machinery and provide experimentally testable predictions for the effects of transport regulation mechanisms such as tethering.'

Intracellular components explore the cytoplasm via active motor-driven transport in conjunction with passive diffusion. We model the motion of organelles in narrow tubular cells using analytical techniques and numerical simulations to study the efficiency of different transport modes in achieving various cellular objectives.

For organelles that search for a specific target, we obtain the average capture time for given transport parameters and show that diffusion and active motion contribute to target capture in the biologically relevant regime. Because many organelles have been found to tether to microtubules when not engaged in active motion, we study the interplay between immobilization due to tethering and increased probability of active transport. We derive parameter-dependent conditions under which tethering enhances long-range transport and improves the target capture time.
