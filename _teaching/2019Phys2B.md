I was the instructor of record for the undergraduate course on Electricity and Magnetism (PHYS 2B) at UCSD during summer session 2019. More than 200 students enrolled over 2 sessions. While teaching the course, I employed multiple active learning strategies which facilitated student learning and engagement.
